# DEVON KISS: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PORTFOLIO
---
## FIND THE DATA JS SUITE THAT TYLER MCGINNIS SAID WAS GREAT FOR BUILDING TABULAR DATA
THERE IS A WEBSITE THAT WAS REFERRED TO IN A GIT PROJECT WHICH SHOWS OFF SOME REALLY,
REALLY GOOD NPM PACKAGES TO ALLOW FOR TABULAR DATA TO BE DISPLAYED IN A CUSTOM WAY,
FIND THAT PACKAGE AND LEARN HOW TO IMPLEMENT WITH IT!

## GOALS TO WORK ON NEXT

- TESTING UI FETURES IMPLEMENTED
- PUBLIC HOMEPAGE
  - USE FIGMA AI TO DESIGN THE HOMEPAGE
  - THE HOMEPAGE NEEDS GREAT, UNSKIPPABLE DATA
  - AMAZING EXPERIENCE, EXPERIENCE VIA SCROLL
    WITH GAME LOOP TECHNIQUES AND JAVASCRIPT
    USE THE GAME ENGINES/ANIMATORS FOR THIS
- COMPLETELY, SITE WIDE, MERGED NAVIGATION TO NAVBAR.JSX
  - FIX LOGGED IN, BUT SHOWING LINK TO LOGIN WHEN VIEWING PUBLIC PAGES
    FROM THE BACKEND DASHBOARD WHERE GUEST VIEW IS FORCED. (THIS WILL FIX THAT)
- UI FEATURE TESTING FOR NAVBAR
- BRING IN METRICS AND ANALYZER/STATISTICS TO SYSTEM AND DASHBOARD

## CREATE PROJECTS WITH IMAGES AND VIDEO TRAILERS AND EXPLANER FOR THE PROJECTS THAT I HAVE COMPLETED
- LOOK ON NOTEPAD FOR PROJECTS TO FEATURE.
- FEATURE THOSE FEATURED PROJECTS RANDOMLY TO EACH NEW USER WITH A DATABASE RECORD
- UNIQUELY PROVABLY RANDOM VIEWS OF FEATURED PROJECTS
- PROJECT RANDOMIZER + MATH AND HOW THIS IS EFFICIENT WITH MATH
- *NO ONE SEES THE SAME ORDERS OF FEATURED IMAGES

## LET PEOPLE KOWN HOW THINGS WORK
- USE THE DASHBOARD ON THIS SITE AS AN EXAMPLE.
- LET THEM VISIT A MOCK DASHBOARD WHICH REFERENCES REAL INFO
- LET THAT REAL INFO BE MIXED WITH SOME PLAYED UP NUMBERS RE: VISIBILITY
- LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO BUILD WEBSITES THAT CONVERT
- OR ADD VALUE TO PROJECTS THAT CANNOT BE FOUND IN MONETARY WAYS, PERHAPS.
